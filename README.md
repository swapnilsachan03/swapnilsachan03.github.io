This portfolio website is a clone of the original [Astro Nano](https://github.com/markhorn-dev/astro-nano) theme by [Mark Horn](https://github.com/markhorn-dev). I had developed a portfolio website of my own, but it is very graphic & has grown 2 years old as of January 2025. With time, I've developed a liking for minimal portfolio designs and this one perfectly ticked all the boxes for me, be it in speed, aesthetics or functionality.

This is why I've decided to stick with this one for now. Maybe I'll develop one more portfolio again soon, this time with a custom CMS!
