I've always wanted to build a minimal portfolio, which has all the basic details about me, such as my projects, work experience, a little bio, social links, etc. But since aeons, I've felt it was too much of a hassle to build such functionality, because I'd either have to use a CMS or build a backend myself, and I am always inclined towards the idea of building a custom API because it gives me the freedom to do whatever the hell I want!

But, but, but, the problem with that is, I'll need to roll out a complete authentication system, set up a database, along with an admin portal on the frontend with support for a RTE, etc. And it is hard to find time for a project which you'll get bored of eventually.

I once built this portfolio during the second year of my college, but eventually got bored of its design too, because at that time, I liked to have my portfolio all colorful and popping, but now I don't fancy it anymore. Plus it was just statiic frontend!

But then, sometime ago, I came around this [Astro Nano](https://github.com/markhorn-dev/astro-nano) theme by [Mark Horn](https://github.com/markhorn-dev). I resisted using this for my portfolio for a very long time because I didn't want to copy someone elese's work (even though it is open-source), but then eventually, I gave in. Considering that I will not post blogs or update content on my portfolio very frequently, the markdown rendering feature that this theme has, makes this portfolio enough for my usecase.

I have deployed this website using GitHub actions so it gets deployed automatically anytime I make a commit, while saving the hassle of building a complex portfolio from scratch wiht custom APIs and DB setup!
